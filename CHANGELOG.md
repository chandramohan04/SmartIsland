- **App Updates & Downloads Layout Alignment (`SmartIslandHomeScreen.kt`)**:
  - Fixed vertical stacking bug in Settings Overview; App Updates & Downloads now renders as a clean horizontal card aligned with Backup & Restore and About.
- **Service Connect / Rebind Stale Notification Flooding (`SmartIslandNotificationListenerService.kt`, `NotificationFilter.kt`)**:
  - On `onListenerConnected()`, only active ongoing notifications (Music, Calls, Timers, Stopwatches, Navigation, Live Activities, Downloads, Hotspot, Recording) are restored; stale standard notifications from the shade are prevented from dumping into the island.
  - Enforced a 1200ms debounce on alert sound playback and 1500ms debounce on auto-expansion during bursts.
  - Implemented per-package standard notification coalescing so older messages from the same chat app are replaced rather than creating dozens of pages.
  - Unconditionally suppressed background sync / polling notifications ("Checking for messages...").
- **Alarm Classification & Timer Pause Intent Resolution (`TimerStopwatchParser.kt`, `NotificationFilter.kt`, `TimerExpanded.kt`, `StopwatchExpanded.kt`)**:
  - Added `isAlarm()` check classifying clock alarms as `IslandMode.Notification`, preventing them from hijacking timer/stopwatch UI.
  - Fixed pause intent resolution to prioritize pause/freeze over stop/cancel, preserving paused timer states.
- **Bluetooth Watch & Wearable Connection Spam Fix (`SystemEventReceiver.kt`, `NotificationFilter.kt`)**:
  - Filtered out smartwatches, fitness trackers, and BLE peripherals from triggering audio Bluetooth popups.
  - Added 30-second debounce per Bluetooth MAC address, preventing reconnect loops (e.g. Galaxy Watch on OneUI) from auto-expanding the island repeatedly.
