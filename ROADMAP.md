# Smart Island Product Roadmap

Last updated: September 20, 2026

## Product direction

Smart Island should become the most reliable, privacy-first, and customizable glanceable activity overlay for Android. It makes important live information easier to act on without replacing the notification shade or collecting personal data.

The roadmap follows three core principles:

1. **Reliability before feature count.** Overlay, notification, media, call, timer, stopwatch, and battery behavior must remain rock-solid across Android versions and major OEM ROMs.
2. **Local by default.** Notification content, history, and preferences stay strictly on-device. Zero analytics, zero tracking, and zero cloud lock-in.
3. **Fast, fluid, and unobtrusive.** The island must use negligible battery, avoid blocking touches, and provide instant haptic and visual feedback.

  - Smooth animation morphing from expanded island card directly into Android Freeform window.

### Phase 6.0 — Ecosystem & Local Cross-Device Status (Q2 2027)

**Goal:** Enable modular community widgets and private multi-device glanceability.

- **Plugin Extension Architecture**:
  - Expose a secure, local IPC API for third-party Android apps to feed live activity status into Smart Island.
